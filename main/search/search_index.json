These recommendations are not specific to Splunk Connect for Syslog, but rather stem from the syslog protocol itself \u2013 and its age. The syslog Protocol \u00b6 The syslog protocol was designed in the mid 1980s to offer very high-speed, network-based logging for network and security devices that were (especially at the time) starved for CPU and I/O resources. For this reason, the protocol was designed for speed and efficiency at the expense of resiliency/reliability. UDP was chosen due to its ability to \u201csend and forget\u201d the events over the network without regard (or acknowledgment) of receipt. In later years, TCP was added as a transport, as well as TLS/SSL. In spite of these additions, UDP still retains favor as a syslog transport for most data centers, and for the same reasons as originally designed. Because of these tradeoffs selected by the original designers (and retained to this day), traditional methods used to provide scale and resiliency do not necessarily transfer to the syslog world. We will discuss (and reference) some of the salient points below. Collector Location \u00b6 Due to syslog being a \u201csend and forget\u201d protocol, it does not perform well when routed through substantial (and especially WAN) network infrastructure. This includes front-side load balancers. The most reliable way to collect syslog traffic is to provide for edge (not centralized) collection. Resist the urge to centrally locate any syslog server (sc4s included) and expect the UDP and (stateless) TCP traffic to \u201cmake it\u201d. Data loss will undoubtedly occur. syslog Data Collection at Scale \u00b6 In concert with attempts to centralize syslog, many admins will co-locate several syslog-ng servers for horizontal scale, and load balance to them with a front-side load balancer. For many reasons (that go beyond this short discussion) this is not a best practice. Briefly: The attempt to load balance for scale (and HA \u2013 see below) will actually cause more data loss due to normal device operations and attendant buffer loss than would be the case if a simple, robust single server (or shared-IP cluster) were used. Front-side load balancing will also cause inadequate data distribution on the upstream side, leading to data unevenness on the indexers. HA Considerations and Challenges \u00b6 In addition to scale, many opt to load balance for high availability. While a sound approach for stateful, application-level protocols such as http, it does not work well for stateless, unacknowledged syslog traffic. Again, in the attempt to design for HA, more data ends up being lost vs. more simple designs such as vMotioned VMs. With syslog, always remember that the protocol itself is lossy, and there will be data loss (think CD-quality (lossless) vs. MP3). Syslog data collection can be made, at best, \u201cMostly Available\u201d. UDP vs. TCP \u00b6 For running syslog UDP is recommended over TCP. The syslogd daemon was originally configured to use UDP for log forwarding to reduce overhead. While UDP is an unreliable protocol, it\u2019s streaming method does not require the overhead of establishing a network session. This protocol also reduces network load as the network stream with no required receipt verification or window adjustment. While TCP could seem a better choice because it uses ACKS and there should not be data loss, there are some cases when it\u2019s possible: * The TCP session is closed events published while the system is creating a new session will be lost. (Closed Window Case) * The remote side is busy and can not ack fast enough events are lost due to local buffer full * A single ack is lost by the network and the client closes the connection. (local and remote buffer lost) * The remote server restarts for any reason (local buffer lost) * The remote server restarts without closing the connection (local buffer plus timeout time lost) * The client side restarts without closing the connection Additionally as stated before it causes more overhead on the network. TCP should be used in case of the syslog event is larger than the maximum size of the UDP packet on your network typically limited to Web Proxy, DLP and IDs type sources. To decrease drawbacks of TCP you can use TLS over TCP: * The TLS can continue a session over a broken TCP reducing buffer loss conditions * The TLS will fill packets for more efficient use of wire * The TLS will compress in most cases","title":"Architectural Considerations"},{"location":"architecture/#sc4s-architectural-considerations","text":"There are some key architectural considerations and recommendations that will yield extremely performant and reliable syslog data collection while minimizing the \u201cover-engineering\u201d that is common in many syslog data collection designs.

Here are the categories and variables needed to properly configure SC4S for your environment. Global Configuration \u00b6 Variable Values Description SC4S_USE_REVERSE_DNS yes or no(default) use reverse DNS to identify hosts when HOST is not valid in the syslog header SC4S_CONTAINER_HOST string variable passed to the container to identify the actual log host for container implementations NOTE: Do not configure HEC Acknowledgement when deploying the HEC token on the Splunk side; the underlying syslog-ng http destination does not support this feature. Moreover, HEC Ack would significantly degrade performance for streaming data such as syslog. NOTE: Use of the SC4S_USE_REVERSE_DNS variable can have a significant impact on performance if the reverse DNS facility (typically a caching nameserver) is not performant. If you notice events being indexed far later than their actual timestamp in the event (latency between _indextime and _time ), this is the first place to check. Configure use of external http proxy \u00b6 Warning: Many http proxies are not provisioned with application traffic in mind. Ensure adequate capacity is available to avoid data loss and or proxy outages. Note: the follow variables are lower case Variable Values Description http_proxy undefined Use libcurl format proxy string \u201chttp://username:password@proxy.server:port\u201d https_proxy undefined Use libcurl format proxy string \u201chttp://username:password@proxy.server:port\u201d Splunk HEC Destination Configuration \u00b6 Variable Values Description SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_CIPHER_SUITE comma separated list Open SSL cipher suite list SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_SSL_VERSION comma separated list Open SSL version list SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS numeric Number of destination workers (default: 10 threads). This should rarely need to be changed; consult sc4s community for advice on appropriate setting in extreme high- or low-volume environments. SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_INDEXED_FIELDS r_unixtime,facility, severity, container, loghost, destport, fromhostip, proto none List of sc4s indexed fields that will be included with each event in Splunk (default is the entire list except \u201cnone\u201d). Two other indexed fields, sc4s_vendor_product and sc4s_syslog_format , will also appear along with the fields selected via the list and cannot be turned on or off individually. If no indexed fields are desired (including the two internal ones), set the value to the single value of \u201cnone\u201d. When setting this variable, separate multiple entries with commas and do not include extra spaces. This list maps to the following indexed fields that will appear in all Splunk events: facility: sc4s_syslog_facility severity: sc4s_syslog_severity container: sc4s_container loghost: sc4s_loghost dport: sc4s_destport fromhostip: sc4s_fromhostip proto: sc4s_proto NOTE: When using alternate HEC destinations, the destination operating parameters outlined above ( CIPHER_SUITE , SSL_VERSION , etc.) can be individually controlled per DESTID (see \u201cConfiguration of Additional Splunk HEC Destinations\u201d immediately below). For example, to set the number of workers for the alternate HEC destination d_hec_FOO to 24, set SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_FOO_WORKERS=24 . NOTE2: Configuration files for destinations must have a .conf extension Configure additional PKI Trust Anchors \u00b6 Additional trusted (private) Certificate authorities may be trusted by appending each PEM formatted certificate to /opt/sc4s/tls/trusted.pem Configuration of timezone for legacy sources \u00b6 Legacy sources (those that remain non compliant with RFC5424) often leave the recipient to guess at the actual time zone offset. SC4S uses an advanced feature of syslog-ng to \u201cguess\u201d the correct time zone for real time sources. However, this feature requires the source (device) clock to be synchronized to within +/- 30s of the SC4S system clock. Industry accepted best practice is to set such legacy systems to GMT (sometimes inaccurately called UTC). However, this is not always possible and in such cases two additional methods are available. For a list of time zones see . Only the \u201cTZ Database name\u201d OR \u201coffset\u201d format may be used. Change Global default time zone \u00b6 This setting is used when the container cost is not set for UTC (best practice). Using this setting is often confusing and should be avoided. Set the SC4S_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE variable to a recognized \u201czone info\u201d (Region/City) time zone format such as America/New_York . Setting this value will force SC4S to use the specified timezone (and honor its associated Daylight Savings/Summer Time rules) for all events without a timezone offset in the header or message payload. SC4S Disk Buffer Configuration \u00b6 Disk buffers in SC4S are allocated per destination . Keep this in mind when using additional destinations that have disk buffering configured. By default, when alternate HEC destinations are configured as outlined above disk buffering will be configured identically to that of the main HEC destination (unless overridden individually). Important Notes Regarding Disk Buffering: \u00b6 \u201cReliable\u201d disk buffering offers little advantage over \u201cnormal\u201d disk buffering, at a significant performance penalty. For this reason, normal disk buffering is recommended. If you add destinations locally in your configuration, pay attention to the cumulative buffer requirements when allocating local disk. Disk buffer storage is configured via container volumes and is persistent between restarts of the container. Be sure to account for disk space requirements on the local sc4s host when creating the container volumes in your respective runtime environment (outlined in the \u201cgetting started\u201d runtime docs). These volumes can grow significantly if there is an extended outage to the SC4S destinations (HEC endpoints). See the \u201cSC4S Disk Buffer Configuration\u201d section on the Configuration page for more info. The values for the variables below represent the total sizes of the buffers for the destination. These sizes are divided by the number of workers (threads) when setting the actual syslog-ng buffer options, because the buffer options apply to each worker rather than the entire destination. Pay careful attention to this when using the \u201cBYOE\u201d version of SC4S, where direct access to the syslog-ng config files may hide this nuance. Lastly, be sure to factor in the syslog-ng data structure overhead (approx. 2x raw message size) when calculating the total buffer size needed.

Save the server private key in PEM format with NO PASSWORD to /opt/sc4s/tls/server.key Save the server certificate in PEM format to /opt/sc4s/tls/server.pem Ensure the entry SC4S_SOURCE_TLS_ENABLE=yes exists in /opt/sc4s/env_file SC4S metadata configuration \u00b6 Log Path overrides of index or metadata \u00b6 A key aspect of SC4S is to properly set Splunk metadata prior to the data arriving in Splunk (and before any TA processing takes place). The filters will apply the proper index, source, sourcetype, host, and timestamp metadata automatically by individual data source. Proper values for this metadata, including a recommended index and output format (template), are included with all \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d log paths included with SC4S and are chosen to properly interface with the corresponding TA in Splunk. The administrator will need to ensure all recommended indexes be created to accept this data if the defaults are not changed. It will be common to override default values in many installations. To accommodate this, each log path consults an internal lookup file that maps Splunk metadata to the specific data source being processed. This file contains the defaults that are used by SC4S to set the appropriate Splunk metadata ( index , host , source , and sourcetype ) for each data source. This file is not directly available to the administrator, but a copy of the file is deposited in the local mounted directory (by default /opt/sc4s/local/context/splunk_metadata.csv.example ) for reference. It is important to note that this copy is not used directly, but is provided solely for reference. To add to the list, or to override default entries, simply create an override file without the example extension (e.g. /opt/sc4s/local/context/splunk_metadata.csv ) and modify it according to the instructions below. splunk_metadata.csv is a CSV file containing a \u201ckey\u201d that is referenced in the log path for each data source. These keys are documented in the individual source files in this section, and allow one to override Splunk metadata either in whole or part. The use of this file is best shown by example. Here is the Netscreen \u201cSourcetype and Index Configuration\u201d table from the Juniper source documentation : key sourcetype index notes juniper_netscreen netscreen:firewall netfw none Here is a line from a typical splunk_metadata.csv override file: juniper_netscreen,index,ns_index The columns in this file are key , metadata , and value . To make a change via the override file, consult the example file (or the source documentation) for the proper key when overriding an existing source and modify and/or add rows in the table, specifying one or more of the following metadata/value pairs for a given key : key which refers to the vendor and product name of the data source, using the vendor_product convention. For overrides, these keys will be listed in the example file. For new (custom) sources, be sure to choose a key that accurately reflects the vendor and product being configured, and that matches what is specified in the log path. index to specify an alternate value for index source to specify an alternate value for source host to specify an alternate value for host sourcetype to specify an alternate value for sourcetype (be very careful when changing this; only do so if an upstream TA is not being used, or a custom TA (built by you) is being used.) sc4s_template to specify an alternate value for the syslog-ng template that will be used to format the event that will be indexed by Splunk. Changing this carries the same warning as the sourcetype above; this will affect the upstream TA. The template choices are documented elsewhere in this Configuration section. In our example above, the juniper_netscreen key references a new index used for that data source called ns_index . In general, for most deployments the index should be the only change needed; other default metadata should almost never be overridden (particularly for the \u201cOut of the Box\u201d data sources). Even then, care should be taken when considering any alternates, as the defaults for SC4S were chosen with best practices in mind. NOTE: The splunk_metadata.csv file is a true override file and the entire example file should not be copied over to the override. In most cases, the override file is just one or two lines, unless an entire index category (e.g. netfw ) needs to be overridden. This is similar in concept to the \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d conf file precedence in Splunk Enterprise. NOTE The splunk_metadata.csv file should always be appended with an appropriate new key and default for the index when building a custom SC4S log path, as the new key will not exist in the internal lookup (nor the example file). Care should be taken during log path design to choose appropriate index, sourcetype and template defaults so that admins are not compelled to override them. If the custom log path is later added to the list of SC4S-supported sources, this addendum can be removed. NOTE: As noted above, the splunk_metadata.csv.example file is provided for reference only and is not used directly by SC4S. However, it is an exact copy of the internal file, and can therefore change from release to release. Be sure to check the example file first to make sure the keys for any overrides map correctly to the ones in the example file. Override index or metadata based on host, ip, or subnet (compliance overrides) \u00b6 In other cases it is appropriate to provide the same overrides but based on PCI scope, geography, or other criterion rather than globally. This is accomplished by the use of a file that uniquely identifies these source exceptions via syslog-ng filters, which maps to an associated lookup of alternate indexes, sources, or other metadata. In addition, (indexed) fields can also be added to further classify the data. The conf and csv files referenced below will be populated into the /opt/sc4s/local/context directory when SC4S is run for the first time after being set up according to the \u201cgetting started\u201d runtime documents, in a similar fashion to splunk_metadata.csv . After this first-time population of the files takes place, they can be edited (and SC4S restarted) for the changes to take effect. To get started: Edit the file compliance_meta_by_source.conf to supply uniquely named filters to identify events subject to override. Edit the file compliance_meta_by_source.csv to supply appropriate field(s) and values. The three columns in the csv file are filter name , field name , and value . Filter names in the conf file must match one or more corresponding filter name rows in the csv file. The field name column obeys the following convention: .splunk.index to specify an alternate value for index .splunk.source to specify an alternate value for source .splunk.sourcetype to specify an alternate value for sourcetype (be very careful when changing this; only do so if a downstream TA is not being used, or a custom TA (built by you) is being used.) fields.fieldname where fieldname will become the name of an indexed field sent to Splunk with the supplied value This file construct is best shown by an example. Here is a sample compliance_meta_by_source.conf file: filter f_test_test { host(\"something-*\" type(glob)) or netmask(192.168.100.1/24) }; and the corresponding compliance_meta_by_source.csv file: f_test_test,.splunk.index,\"pciindex\" f_test_test,fields.compliance,\"pci\" First off, ensure that the filter name(s) in the conf file match one or more rows in the csv file. In this case, any incoming message with a hostname starting with something- or arriving from a netmask of 192.168.100.1/24 will match the f_test_test filter, and the corresponding entries in the csv file will be checked for overrides. In this case, the new index is pciindex , and an indexed field named compliance will be sent to Splunk, with it\u2019s value set to pci . To add additional overrides, simply add another filter foo_bar {}; stanza to the conf file, and add appropriate entries to the csv file that match the filter name(s) to the overrides you desire. IMPORTANT: The files above are actual syslog-ng config file snippets that get parsed directly by the underlying syslog-ng process. Take care that your syntax is correct; for more information on proper syslog-ng syntax, see the syslog-ng documentation . A syntax error will cause the runtime process to abort in the \u201cpreflight\u201d phase at startup. Finally, to update your changes for the systemd-based runtimes, restart SC4S using the commands: sudo systemctl daemon - reload sudo systemctl restart sc4s For the Docker Swarm runtime, redeploy the updated service using the command: docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml sc4s Dropping all data by ip or subnet (deprecated) \u00b6 The use of vendor_product_by_source to null queue is deprecated and will be removed in v3. See Filtering events from output In some cases rogue or port-probing data can be sent to SC4S from misconfigured devices or vulnerability scanners. Update the vendor_product_by_source.conf filter f_null_queue with one or more ip/subnet masks to drop events without logging. Note that drop metrics will be recorded. Fixing (overriding) the host field \u00b6 In some cases the host value is not present in an event (or an IP address is in its place). For administrators who require a true hostname be attached to each event, SC4S provides an optional facility to perform a reverse IP to name lookup. If the variable SC4S_USE_REVERSE_DNS is set to \u201cyes\u201d, SC4S will first check host.csv and replace the value of host with the value specified that matches the incoming IP address. If a value is not found in host.csv then a reverse DNS lookup will be attempted against the configured nameserver. The IP address will only be used as the host value as a last resort. NOTE: Use of this variable can have a significant impact on performance if the reverse DNS facility (typically a caching nameserver) is not performant. If you notice events being indexed far later than their actual timestamp in the event (latency between _indextime and _time ), this is the first place to check. Splunk Connect for Syslog output templates (syslog-ng templates) \u00b6 Splunk Connect for Syslog utilizes the syslog-ng template mechanism to format the output payload (event) that will be sent to Splunk. These templates can format the messages in a number of ways (straight text, JSON, etc.) as well as utilize the many syslog-ng \u201cmacros\u201d (fields) to specify what gets placed in the payload that is delivered to the destination. Here is a list of the templates used in SC4S, which can be used in the metadata override section immediately above. New templates can also be added by the administrator in the \u201clocal\u201d section for local destinations; pay careful attention to the syntax as the templates are \u201clive\u201d syslog-ng config code. Template name Template contents Notes t_standard ${DATE} ${HOST} ${MSGHDR}${MESSAGE} Standard template for most RFC3164 (standard syslog) traffic t_msg_only ${MSGONLY} syslog-ng $MSG is sent, no headers (host, timestamp, etc.) t_msg_trim $(strip $MSGONLY) As above with whitespace stripped t_everything ${ISODATE} ${HOST} ${MSGHDR}${MESSAGE} Standard template with ISO date format t_hdr_msg ${MSGHDR}${MESSAGE} Useful for non-compliant syslog messages t_legacy_hdr_msg ${LEGACY_MSGHDR}${MESSAGE} Useful for non-compliant syslog messages t_hdr_sdata_msg ${MSGHDR}${MSGID} ${SDATA} ${MESSAGE} Useful for non-compliant syslog messages t_program_msg ${PROGRAM}[${PID}]: ${MESSAGE} Useful for non-compliant syslog messages t_program_nopid_msg ${PROGRAM}: ${MESSAGE} Useful for non-compliant syslog messages t_JSON_3164 $(format-json \u2013scope rfc3164 \u2013pair PRI=\u201d<$PRI>\u201d \u2013key LEGACY_MSGHDR \u2013exclude FACILITY \u2013exclude PRIORITY) JSON output of all RFC3164-based syslog-ng macros.

Data Resilience - Local Disk Buffer Configuration \u00b6 SC4S provides capability to minimize the number of lost events if the connection to all the Splunk Indexers goes down. This capability utilizes the disk buffering feature of Syslog-ng. SC4S receives a response from the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) when a message is received successfully. If a confirmation message from the HEC endpoint is not received (or a \u201cserver busy\u201d reply, such as a \u201c503\u201d is sent), the load balancer will try the next HEC endpoint in the pool. If all pool members are exhausted (such as would occur if there were a full network outage to the HEC endpoints), events will queue to the local disk buffer on the SC4S Linux host. SC4S will continue attempting to send the failed events while it buffers all new incoming events to disk. If the disk space allocated to disk buffering fills up then SC4S will stop accepting new events and subsequent events will be lost. Once SC4S gets confirmation that events are again being received by one or more indexers, events will then stream from the buffer using FIFO queueing. The number of events in the disk buffer will reduce as long as the incoming event volume is less than the maximum SC4S (with the disk buffer in the path) can handle. When all events have been emptied from the disk buffer, SC4S will resume streaming events directly to Splunk. For more detail on the Syslog-ng behavior the documentation can be found here: https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.22/administration-guide/55#TOPIC-1209280 SC4S has disk buffering enabled by default and it is strongly recommended that you keep it on, however this feature does have a performance cost. Without disk buffering enabled SC4S can handle up to 345K EPS (800 bytes/event avg) With \u201cNormal\u201d disk buffering enabled SC4S can handle up to 60K EPS (800 bytes/event avg) \u2013 This is still a lot of data! To guard against data loss it is important to configure the appropriate type and amount of storage for SC4S disk buffering. To estimate the storage allocation, follow these steps: Start with your estimated maximum events per second that each SC4S server will experience. Based on the maximum throughput of SC4S with disk buffering enabled, the conservative estimate for maximum events per second would be 60K (however, you should use the maximum rate in your environment for this calculation, not the max rate SC4S can handle). Next is your average estimated event size based on your data sources. It is common industry practice to estimate log events as 800 bytes on average. Then, factor in the maximum length of connectivity downtime you want disk buffering to be able to handle. This measure is very much dependent on your risk tolerance. Lastly, syslog-ng imposes significant overhead to maintain its internal data structures (primarily macros) so that the data can be properly \u201cplayed back\u201d upon network restoration. This overhead currently runs at about 1.7x above the total storage size for the raw messages themselves, and can be higher for \u201cfallback\u201d data sources due to the overlap of syslog-ng macros (data fields) containing some or all of the original message. For example, to protect against a full day of lost connectivity from SC4S to all your indexers at maximum throughput the calculation would look like the following: 60,000 EPS * 86400 seconds * 800 bytes * 1.7 = 6.4 TB of storage To configure storage allocation for the SC4S disk buffering, do the following: Edit the file /opt/sc4s/default/env_file Add the SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DISKBUFF_DISKBUFSIZE variable to the file and set the value to the number of bytes based on your estimation (e.g. 7050240000000 in the example above) Splunk does not recommend reducing the disk allocation below 500 GB Restart SC4S Given that in a connectivity outage to the Indexers events will be saved and read from disk until the buffer is emptied, it is ideal to use the fastest type of storage available. For this reason, NVMe storage is recommended for SC4S disk buffering. It is best to design your deployment so that the disk buffer will drain after connectivity is restored to the Splunk Indexers (while incoming data continues at the same general rate). Since \u201cyour mileage may vary\u201d with different combinations of data load, instance type, and disk subsystem performance, it is good practice to provision a box that performs twice as well as is required for your max EPS. This headroom will allow for rapid recovery after a connectivity outage.

For this reason, normal disk buffering is recommended. If you add destinations locally in your configuration, pay attention to the cumulative buffer requirements when allocating local disk. Disk buffer storage is configured via container volumes and is persistent between restarts of the container. Be sure to account for disk space requirements on the local sc4s host when creating the container volumes in your respective runtime environment (outlined in the \u201cgetting started\u201d runtime docs). These volumes can grow significantly if there is an extended outage to the SC4S destinations (HEC endpoints). See the \u201cSC4S Disk Buffer Configuration\u201d section on the Configuration page for more info. The values for the variables below represent the total sizes of the buffers for the destination. These sizes are divided by the number of workers (threads) when setting the actual syslog-ng buffer options, because the buffer options apply to each worker rather than the entire destination. Pay careful attention to this when using the \u201cBYOE\u201d version of SC4S, where direct access to the syslog-ng config files may hide this nuance. Lastly, be sure to factor in the syslog-ng data structure overhead (approx. 2x raw message size) when calculating the total buffer size needed.

The filters will apply the proper index, source, sourcetype, host, and timestamp metadata automatically by individual data source. Proper values for this metadata, including a recommended index and output format (template), are included with all \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d log paths included with SC4S and are chosen to properly interface with the corresponding TA in Splunk. The administrator will need to ensure all recommended indexes be created to accept this data if the defaults are not changed. It will be common to override default values in many installations. To accommodate this, each log path consults an internal lookup file that maps Splunk metadata to the specific data source being processed. This file contains the defaults that are used by SC4S to set the appropriate Splunk metadata ( index , host , source , and sourcetype ) for each data source. This file is not directly available to the administrator, but a copy of the file is deposited in the local mounted directory (by default /opt/sc4s/local/context/splunk_metadata.csv.example ) for reference. It is important to note that this copy is not used directly, but is provided solely for reference. To add to the list, or to override default entries, simply create an override file without the example extension (e.g. /opt/sc4s/local/context/splunk_metadata.csv ) and modify it according to the instructions below. splunk_metadata.csv is a CSV file containing a \u201ckey\u201d that is referenced in the log path for each data source. These keys are documented in the individual source files in this section, and allow one to override Splunk metadata either in whole or part. The use of this file is best shown by example. Here is the Netscreen \u201cSourcetype and Index Configuration\u201d table from the Juniper source documentation : key sourcetype index notes juniper_netscreen netscreen:firewall netfw none Here is a line from a typical splunk_metadata.csv override file: juniper_netscreen,index,ns_index The columns in this file are key , metadata , and value . To make a change via the override file, consult the example file (or the source documentation) for the proper key when overriding an existing source and modify and/or add rows in the table, specifying one or more of the following metadata/value pairs for a given key : key which refers to the vendor and product name of the data source, using the vendor_product convention. For overrides, these keys will be listed in the example file. For new (custom) sources, be sure to choose a key that accurately reflects the vendor and product being configured, and that matches what is specified in the log path. index to specify an alternate value for index source to specify an alternate value for source host to specify an alternate value for host sourcetype to specify an alternate value for sourcetype (be very careful when changing this; only do so if an upstream TA is not being used, or a custom TA (built by you) is being used.) sc4s_template to specify an alternate value for the syslog-ng template that will be used to format the event that will be indexed by Splunk. Changing this carries the same warning as the sourcetype above; this will affect the upstream TA. The template choices are documented elsewhere in this Configuration section. In our example above, the juniper_netscreen key references a new index used for that data source called ns_index . In general, for most deployments the index should be the only change needed; other default metadata should almost never be overridden (particularly for the \u201cOut of the Box\u201d data sources). Even then, care should be taken when considering any alternates, as the defaults for SC4S were chosen with best practices in mind. NOTE: The splunk_metadata.csv file is a true override file and the entire example file should not be copied over to the override. In most cases, the override file is just one or two lines, unless an entire index category (e.g. netfw ) needs to be overridden. This is similar in concept to the \u201cdefault\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d conf file precedence in Splunk Enterprise. NOTE The splunk_metadata.csv file should always be appended with an appropriate new key and default for the index when building a custom SC4S log path, as the new key will not exist in the internal lookup (nor the example file). Care should be taken during log path design to choose appropriate index, sourcetype and template defaults so that admins are not compelled to override them. If the custom log path is later added to the list of SC4S-supported sources, this addendum can be removed. NOTE: As noted above, the splunk_metadata.csv.example file is provided for reference only and is not used directly by SC4S. However, it is an exact copy of the internal file, and can therefore change from release to release. Be sure to check the example file first to make sure the keys for any overrides map correctly to the ones in the example file.","title":"Log Path overrides of index or metadata"},{"location":"configuration/#override-index-or-metadata-based-on-host-ip-or-subnet-compliance-overrides","text":"In other cases it is appropriate to provide the same overrides but based on PCI scope, geography, or other criterion rather than globally. This is accomplished by the use of a file that uniquely identifies these source exceptions via syslog-ng filters, which maps to an associated lookup of alternate indexes, sources, or other metadata. In addition, (indexed) fields can also be added to further classify the data. The conf and csv files referenced below will be populated into the /opt/sc4s/local/context directory when SC4S is run for the first time after being set up according to the \u201cgetting started\u201d runtime documents, in a similar fashion to splunk_metadata.csv . After this first-time population of the files takes place, they can be edited (and SC4S restarted) for the changes to take effect. To get started: Edit the file compliance_meta_by_source.conf to supply uniquely named filters to identify events subject to override. Edit the file compliance_meta_by_source.csv to supply appropriate field(s) and values. The three columns in the csv file are filter name , field name , and value . Filter names in the conf file must match one or more corresponding filter name rows in the csv file. The field name column obeys the following convention: .splunk.index to specify an alternate value for index .splunk.source to specify an alternate value for source .splunk.sourcetype to specify an alternate value for sourcetype (be very careful when changing this; only do so if a downstream TA is not being used, or a custom TA (built by you) is being used.) fields.fieldname where fieldname will become the name of an indexed field sent to Splunk with the supplied value This file construct is best shown by an example. Here is a sample compliance_meta_by_source.conf file: filter f_test_test { host(\"something-*\" type(glob)) or netmask(192.168.100.1/24) }; and the corresponding compliance_meta_by_source.csv file: f_test_test,.splunk.index,\"pciindex\" f_test_test,fields.compliance,\"pci\" First off, ensure that the filter name(s) in the conf file match one or more rows in the csv file. In this case, any incoming message with a hostname starting with something- or arriving from a netmask of 192.168.100.1/24 will match the f_test_test filter, and the corresponding entries in the csv file will be checked for overrides. In this case, the new index is pciindex , and an indexed field named compliance will be sent to Splunk, with it\u2019s value set to pci . To add additional overrides, simply add another filter foo_bar {}; stanza to the conf file, and add appropriate entries to the csv file that match the filter name(s) to the overrides you desire.

This capability utilizes the disk buffering feature of Syslog-ng. SC4S receives a response from the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) when a message is received successfully. If a confirmation message from the HEC endpoint is not received (or a \u201cserver busy\u201d reply, such as a \u201c503\u201d is sent), the load balancer will try the next HEC endpoint in the pool. If all pool members are exhausted (such as would occur if there were a full network outage to the HEC endpoints), events will queue to the local disk buffer on the SC4S Linux host. SC4S will continue attempting to send the failed events while it buffers all new incoming events to disk. If the disk space allocated to disk buffering fills up then SC4S will stop accepting new events and subsequent events will be lost. Once SC4S gets confirmation that events are again being received by one or more indexers, events will then stream from the buffer using FIFO queueing. The number of events in the disk buffer will reduce as long as the incoming event volume is less than the maximum SC4S (with the disk buffer in the path) can handle. When all events have been emptied from the disk buffer, SC4S will resume streaming events directly to Splunk. For more detail on the Syslog-ng behavior the documentation can be found here: https://www.syslog-ng.com/technical-documents/doc/syslog-ng-open-source-edition/3.22/administration-guide/55#TOPIC-1209280 SC4S has disk buffering enabled by default and it is strongly recommended that you keep it on, however this feature does have a performance cost. Without disk buffering enabled SC4S can handle up to 345K EPS (800 bytes/event avg) With \u201cNormal\u201d disk buffering enabled SC4S can handle up to 60K EPS (800 bytes/event avg) \u2013 This is still a lot of data! To guard against data loss it is important to configure the appropriate type and amount of storage for SC4S disk buffering. To estimate the storage allocation, follow these steps: Start with your estimated maximum events per second that each SC4S server will experience. Based on the maximum throughput of SC4S with disk buffering enabled, the conservative estimate for maximum events per second would be 60K (however, you should use the maximum rate in your environment for this calculation, not the max rate SC4S can handle). Next is your average estimated event size based on your data sources. It is common industry practice to estimate log events as 800 bytes on average. Then, factor in the maximum length of connectivity downtime you want disk buffering to be able to handle. This measure is very much dependent on your risk tolerance. Lastly, syslog-ng imposes significant overhead to maintain its internal data structures (primarily macros) so that the data can be properly \u201cplayed back\u201d upon network restoration. This overhead currently runs at about 1.7x above the total storage size for the raw messages themselves, and can be higher for \u201cfallback\u201d data sources due to the overlap of syslog-ng macros (data fields) containing some or all of the original message. For example, to protect against a full day of lost connectivity from SC4S to all your indexers at maximum throughput the calculation would look like the following: 60,000 EPS * 86400 seconds * 800 bytes * 1.7 = 6.4 TB of storage To configure storage allocation for the SC4S disk buffering, do the following: Edit the file /opt/sc4s/default/env_file Add the SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DISKBUFF_DISKBUFSIZE variable to the file and set the value to the number of bytes based on your estimation (e.g. 7050240000000 in the example above) Splunk does not recommend reducing the disk allocation below 500 GB Restart SC4S Given that in a connectivity outage to the Indexers events will be saved and read from disk until the buffer is emptied, it is ideal to use the fastest type of storage available. For this reason, NVMe storage is recommended for SC4S disk buffering. It is best to design your deployment so that the disk buffer will drain after connectivity is restored to the Splunk Indexers (while incoming data continues at the same general rate). Since \u201cyour mileage may vary\u201d with different combinations of data load, instance type, and disk subsystem performance, it is good practice to provision a box that performs twice as well as is required for your max EPS. This headroom will allow for rapid recovery after a connectivity outage.","title":"Data Resilience - Local Disk Buffer Configuration"},{"location":"configuration/#misc-options","text":"SC4S_LISTEN_STATUS_PORT Change the \u201cstatus\u201d port used by the internal health check process default value is 8080","title":"Misc options"},{"location":"destinations/","text":"SC4S Destination Configuration \u00b6 Splunk Connect for Syslog can be configured to utilize any destination available in syslog-ng OSE.

Why switch to a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) based architecture? A: Using HEC to stream events directly to the Indexers provides superior load balancing which has shown to produce dramatically more even data distribution across the Indexers. This even distribution results in significantly enhanced search performance. This benefit is especially valuable in large Splunk deployments. The HEC architecture designed into SC4S is also far easier to administer with newer versions of syslog-ng, which SC4S takes advantage of. There are far fewer opportunities for mis-configuration, resulting in higher overall performance and customer adoption. Lastly, HEC (and in particular, the \u201c/event\u201d endpoint) offers the opportunity for a far richer data stream to Splunk, with lower resource utilization at ingest. This rich data stream can be taken advantage of in next-generation TAs. Q: Is the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) as reliable as the Splunk Universal Forwarder? A: HEC utilizes standard HTTP mechanisms to confirm that the endpoint is responsive before sending data. The HEC architecture allows for the use of an industry standard load balancer between SC4S and the Indexer, or the included load balancing capability built into SC4S itself. Q: What if my team doesn\u2019t know how to manage containers? A: SC4S supports both container-based and \u201cbring-your-own-environment\u201d (BYOE) deployment methods. That said, using a runtime like Podman to deploy and manage SC4S containers is exceptionally easy even for those with no prior \u201ccontainer experience\u201d. Our application of container technology behaves much like a packaging system. The interaction is mostly via \u201csystemctl\u201d commands a Linux admin would use for other common administration activities. The best approach is to try it out in a lab to see what the experience is like for yourself! BYOE is intended for advanced deployments that can not use the Splunk container for some reason. One possible reason is a need to \u201cfork\u201d SC4S in order to implement heavy bespoke customization. Though many will initially gravitate toward BYOE because managing config files and syslog-ng directly is \u201cwhat they know\u201d, most enterprises will have the best experience using the container approach. Q: Can my team use SC4S if we are Windows only shop? A: You can now run Docker on Windows! Microsoft has introduced public preview technology for Linux containers on Windows. Alternatively, a minimal Centos/Ubuntu Linux VM running on Windows hyper-v is a reliable production-grade choice. Q: My company has the traditional UF/files based syslog architecture deployed and running, should I rip/replace a working installation with SC4S? A: Generally speaking, if a deployment is working and you are happy with it, it\u2019s best to leave it as is until there is need for major deployment changes such as higher scale. That said, the search performance gains realized from better data distribution is a benefit not to be overlooked. If Splunk users have complained about search performance or you are curious about the possible performance gains, we recommend doing an analysis of the data distribution across the indexers. It may make sense to upgrade to SC4S if there is a change in administration as well. Properly architecting a performant UF/files syslog-ng deployment is difficult, and an administrative personnel change offers the opportunity to \u201cmake a break\u201d to SC4S, where a new set of administrators would otherwise be tasked with understanding the existing (likely complicated) architecture. Q: What is the best way to migrate to SC4S from an existing syslog architecture? A: When exploring migration to SC4S we strongly recommend experimentation in a lab prior to deployment to production. There are a couple of approaches to consider: One option is to stand up and configure the new SC4S infrastructure for all your sources, then confirm all the sourcetypes are being indexed as expected, and finally stop the existing syslog servers. This big bang approach may result in the fewest duplicate events in Splunk vs other options. In some large or complex environments this may not be feasible however. A second option is to start with the sources currently sending events on port 514 (the default). In this case you would stand up the new SC4S infrastructure in its default configuration, confirm all the sourcetypes are being indexed as expected, then retire the old syslog servers listening on port 514. Once the 514 sources are complete you can move on to migrating any other sources one by one. To migrate these other sources you would configure SC4S filters to explicitly identify them either via unique port, hostID or CIDR block. Again, once you confirm that each sourcetype is successfully being indexed then you may disable the old syslog configurations for that source. Q: How can SC4S be deployed to provide high availability? A: It is challenging to provide HA for syslog because the syslog protocol itself was not designed with HA as a goal. See Performant AND Reliable Syslog UDP is best for an excellent overview of this topic. The gist is that the protocol itself limits the extent to which you can make any syslog collection architecture HA; at best it can be made \u201cmostly available\u201d. Think of syslog as MP3 \u2013 it is a \u201clossy\u201d protocol and there is nothing you can do to restore it to CD quality (lossless). Some have attempted to implement HA via front-side load balancers; please don\u2019t! This is the most common architectural mistake folks make when architecting large-scale syslog data collection. So \u2013 how to make it \u201cmostly available\u201d? Keep it simple, and use OS clustering (shared IP) or even just VMs with vMotion. This simple architecture will encounter far less data loss over time than more complicated schemes. Another possible option being evaluated is containerization HA schemes for SC4S (centered around microk8s) that will take some of the admin burden of clustering away \u2013 but it is still OS clustering under the hood. Q: I\u2019m worried about data loss if SC4S goes down. Could I feed syslog to redundant SC4S servers to provide HA, without creating duplicate events in Splunk? A: In many/most system design decisions there is some level of compromise. Any network protocol that doesn\u2019t have an application level ack will lose data, as speed was selected over reliability in the design, this is the case with syslog. Use of a clustered IP with an active/passive node will however offer a level of resilience while keeping complexity to a minimum. It could be possible to implement a far more complex solution utilizing an additional intermediary technology like Kafka, however the costs may outweigh the real world benefits. Q: Can the SC4S container be deployed using OpenShift or K8s? A: There are a number of reasons that OpenShift/K8s are not a good fit for syslog, SNMP or SIP. They can\u2019t use UDP and TCP on the same port which breaks multiple Bluecoat and Cisco feeds among others. Layered networking shrinks the maximum UDP message which causes data loss due to truncation and drops Long lived TCP connections cause well known problems OpenShift doesn\u2019t actually use Podman, it uses a library to wrap OCI that Podman also uses. this wrapper around the wrapper has some shortcomings that prevent the service definitions SC4S requires. Basically, K8s was built for a very different set of problems than syslog Q: If the XL reference HW can handle just under 1 TB/day how can SC4S be scaled to handle large deployments of many TB/day? A: SC4S is a distributed architecture. SC4S instances should be deployed in the same VLAN as the source devices. This means that each SC4S instance will only see a subset of the total syslog traffic in a large deployment. Even in a 100+ TB deployment the individual SC4S instances will see loads in GB/day not TB/day. Q: How are security vulnerabilities handled with SC4S? A: SC4S is comprised of several components including RHL, Syslog-ng and temporized configurations. If a vulnerability is found in the SC4S configurations, they will be given a critical priority in the Development queue. If vulnerabilities are identified in the third party components (RHL, Syslog-ng, etc.) the fixed versions will be pulled in upon the next SC4S release. Fixed security issues are identified by \u201c[security]\u201d in SC4S release notes. Q: SC4S is being blocked by fapolicyd , how do I fix that? Create a rule that allows running sc4s in fapolicyd configuration: * Create the file /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/15-sc4s.rules . * Put this into the file: allow perm=open exe=/ : dir=/usr/lib64/ all trust=1 . * Run fagenrules --load to load the new rule. * Run systemctl restart fapolicyd to restart the process. * Start sc4s systemctl start sc4s and verify there are no errors systemctl status sc4s. Q: I am facing a unique issue that my postfilter configuration is not working although i don\u2019t have any postfilter for the mentioned source?

Why switch to a HTTP Event Collector (HEC) based architecture? A: Using HEC to stream events directly to the Indexers provides superior load balancing which has shown to produce dramatically more even data distribution across the Indexers. This even distribution results in significantly enhanced search performance. This benefit is especially valuable in large Splunk deployments. The HEC architecture designed into SC4S is also far easier to administer with newer versions of syslog-ng, which SC4S takes advantage of. There are far fewer opportunities for mis-configuration, resulting in higher overall performance and customer adoption. Lastly, HEC (and in particular, the \u201c/event\u201d endpoint) offers the opportunity for a far richer data stream to Splunk, with lower resource utilization at ingest. This rich data stream can be taken advantage of in next-generation TAs. Q: Is the Splunk HTTP Event Collector (HEC) as reliable as the Splunk Universal Forwarder? A: HEC utilizes standard HTTP mechanisms to confirm that the endpoint is responsive before sending data. The HEC architecture allows for the use of an industry standard load balancer between SC4S and the Indexer, or the included load balancing capability built into SC4S itself. Q: What if my team doesn\u2019t know how to manage containers? A: SC4S supports both container-based and \u201cbring-your-own-environment\u201d (BYOE) deployment methods. That said, using a runtime like Podman to deploy and manage SC4S containers is exceptionally easy even for those with no prior \u201ccontainer experience\u201d. Our application of container technology behaves much like a packaging system. The interaction is mostly via \u201csystemctl\u201d commands a Linux admin would use for other common administration activities. The best approach is to try it out in a lab to see what the experience is like for yourself! BYOE is intended for advanced deployments that can not use the Splunk container for some reason. One possible reason is a need to \u201cfork\u201d SC4S in order to implement heavy bespoke customization. Though many will initially gravitate toward BYOE because managing config files and syslog-ng directly is \u201cwhat they know\u201d, most enterprises will have the best experience using the container approach. Q: Can my team use SC4S if we are Windows only shop? A: You can now run Docker on Windows! Microsoft has introduced public preview technology for Linux containers on Windows. Alternatively, a minimal Centos/Ubuntu Linux VM running on Windows hyper-v is a reliable production-grade choice. Q: My company has the traditional UF/files based syslog architecture deployed and running, should I rip/replace a working installation with SC4S? A: Generally speaking, if a deployment is working and you are happy with it, it\u2019s best to leave it as is until there is need for major deployment changes such as higher scale. That said, the search performance gains realized from better data distribution is a benefit not to be overlooked. If Splunk users have complained about search performance or you are curious about the possible performance gains, we recommend doing an analysis of the data distribution across the indexers. It may make sense to upgrade to SC4S if there is a change in administration as well. Properly architecting a performant UF/files syslog-ng deployment is difficult, and an administrative personnel change offers the opportunity to \u201cmake a break\u201d to SC4S, where a new set of administrators would otherwise be tasked with understanding the existing (likely complicated) architecture. Q: What is the best way to migrate to SC4S from an existing syslog architecture? A: When exploring migration to SC4S we strongly recommend experimentation in a lab prior to deployment to production. There are a couple of approaches to consider: One option is to stand up and configure the new SC4S infrastructure for all your sources, then confirm all the sourcetypes are being indexed as expected, and finally stop the existing syslog servers. This big bang approach may result in the fewest duplicate events in Splunk vs other options. In some large or complex environments this may not be feasible however. A second option is to start with the sources currently sending events on port 514 (the default). In this case you would stand up the new SC4S infrastructure in its default configuration, confirm all the sourcetypes are being indexed as expected, then retire the old syslog servers listening on port 514. Once the 514 sources are complete you can move on to migrating any other sources one by one. To migrate these other sources you would configure SC4S filters to explicitly identify them either via unique port, hostID or CIDR block. Again, once you confirm that each sourcetype is successfully being indexed then you may disable the old syslog configurations for that source. Q: How can SC4S be deployed to provide high availability? A: It is challenging to provide HA for syslog because the syslog protocol itself was not designed with HA as a goal. See Performant AND Reliable Syslog UDP is best for an excellent overview of this topic. The gist is that the protocol itself limits the extent to which you can make any syslog collection architecture HA; at best it can be made \u201cmostly available\u201d. Think of syslog as MP3 \u2013 it is a \u201clossy\u201d protocol and there is nothing you can do to restore it to CD quality (lossless). Some have attempted to implement HA via front-side load balancers; please don\u2019t! This is the most common architectural mistake folks make when architecting large-scale syslog data collection. So \u2013 how to make it \u201cmostly available\u201d? Keep it simple, and use OS clustering (shared IP) or even just VMs with vMotion. This simple architecture will encounter far less data loss over time than more complicated schemes. Another possible option being evaluated is containerization HA schemes for SC4S (centered around microk8s) that will take some of the admin burden of clustering away \u2013 but it is still OS clustering under the hood. Q: I\u2019m worried about data loss if SC4S goes down. Could I feed syslog to redundant SC4S servers to provide HA, without creating duplicate events in Splunk? A: In many/most system design decisions there is some level of compromise. Any network protocol that doesn\u2019t have an application level ack will lose data, as speed was selected over reliability in the design, this is the case with syslog. Use of a clustered IP with an active/passive node will however offer a level of resilience while keeping complexity to a minimum. It could be possible to implement a far more complex solution utilizing an additional intermediary technology like Kafka, however the costs may outweigh the real world benefits. Q: Can the SC4S container be deployed using OpenShift or K8s? A: There are a number of reasons that OpenShift/K8s are not a good fit for syslog, SNMP or SIP. They can\u2019t use UDP and TCP on the same port which breaks multiple Bluecoat and Cisco feeds among others. Layered networking shrinks the maximum UDP message which causes data loss due to truncation and drops Long lived TCP connections cause well known problems OpenShift doesn\u2019t actually use Podman, it uses a library to wrap OCI that Podman also uses. this wrapper around the wrapper has some shortcomings that prevent the service definitions SC4S requires. Basically, K8s was built for a very different set of problems than syslog Q: If the XL reference HW can handle just under 1 TB/day how can SC4S be scaled to handle large deployments of many TB/day? A: SC4S is a distributed architecture. SC4S instances should be deployed in the same VLAN as the source devices. This means that each SC4S instance will only see a subset of the total syslog traffic in a large deployment. Even in a 100+ TB deployment the individual SC4S instances will see loads in GB/day not TB/day. Q: How are security vulnerabilities handled with SC4S? A: SC4S is comprised of several components including RHL, Syslog-ng and temporized configurations. If a vulnerability is found in the SC4S configurations, they will be given a critical priority in the Development queue. If vulnerabilities are identified in the third party components (RHL, Syslog-ng, etc.) the fixed versions will be pulled in upon the next SC4S release. Fixed security issues are identified by \u201c[security]\u201d in SC4S release notes. Q: SC4S is being blocked by fapolicyd , how do I fix that? Create a rule that allows running sc4s in fapolicyd configuration: * Create the file /etc/fapolicyd/rules.d/15-sc4s.rules . * Put this into the file: allow perm=open exe=/ : dir=/usr/lib64/ all trust=1 . * Run fagenrules --load to load the new rule. * Run systemctl restart fapolicyd to restart the process. * Start sc4s systemctl start sc4s and verify there are no errors systemctl status sc4s. Q: I am facing a unique issue that my postfilter configuration is not working although i don\u2019t have any postfilter for the mentioned source? A: There is a possibility that there is OOB postfilter for the source which will be applied , the same can be validated by checking the value of sc4s_tags in splunk UI, to fix this Please use a new topic called [sc4s-finalfilter] please don\u2019t use it in any other case as it can add the cost of the processing of data Q: Where the config for the vendors should be placed?

The container deliverable is the most often correct deliverable of SC4S for almost all enterprises. If you are simply trying to \u201cget syslog working\u201d, the turnkey, container approach described in the other runtime documents will be the fastest route to success. The \u201cBring Your Own Environment\u201d instructions that follow allow expert administrators to utilize the SC4S syslog-ng config files directly on the host OS running on a hardware server or virtual machine. Administrators must provide an appropriate host OS (RHEL 8 used in this document) as well as an up-to-date syslog-ng installation either built from source (not documented here) or installed from community-built RPMs. Modification of the base configuration will be required for most customer environments due to enterprise infrastructure variations. Once installed preparing an upgrade requires evaluation of the current environment compared to this reference then developing and testing a installation specific install plan. This activity is the responsibility of the administrator. NOTE: Installing or modifying system configurations can have unexpected consequences, and advanced linux system administration and syslog-ng configuration experience is assumed when using the BYOE version of SC4S. NOTE: Do not depend on the distribution-supplied version of syslog-ng, as it will likely be far too old. Read this explanation for the reason why syslog-ng builds are so dated in almost all RHEL/Debian distributions. BYOE Installation Instructions \u00b6 These installation instructions assume a recent RHEL or CentOS-based release. Minor adjustments may have to be made for Debian/Ubuntu. In addition, almost all pre-compiled binaries for syslog-ng assume installation in /etc/syslog-ng ; these instructions will reflect that. The following installation instructions are summarized from a blog maintained by a developer at One Identity (formerly Balabit), who is the owner of the syslog-ng Open Source project. It is always advisable to review the blog for the latest changes to the repo(s), as changes here are quite dynamic. Install CentOS or RHEL 8.0 Enable EPEL (Centos 8) dnf install 'dnf-command(copr)' -y dnf install epel-release -y dnf copr enable czanik/syslog-ng336 -y dnf install syslog-ng syslog-ng-python syslog-ng-http python3-pip gcc python3-devel -y Disable the distro-supplied syslog-ng unit file, as the syslog-ng process configured here will run as the sc4s service. rsyslog will continue to be the system logger, but should be left enabled only if it is configured to not listen on the same ports as sc4s. sc4s BYOE can be configured to provide local logging as well if desired. sudo systemctl stop syslog-ng sudo systemctl disable syslog-ng Download the latest bare_metal.tar from releases on github and untar the package in /etc/syslog-ng using the command example below. NOTE: The wget process below will unpack a tarball with the sc4s version of the syslog-ng config files in the standard /etc/syslog-ng location, and will overwrite existing content. Ensure that any previous configurations of syslog-ng are saved if needed prior to executing the download step. NOTE: At the time of writing, the latest major release is v1.33 . The latest release is typically listed first on the page above, unless there is an -alpha , -beta , or -rc release that is newer (which will be clearly indicated). For production use, select the latest that does not have an -rc , -alpha , or -beta suffix. sudo wget -c https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/releases/download/<latest release>/baremetal.tar -O - | sudo tar -x -C /etc/syslog-ng Install python requirements sudo pip3 install -r /etc/syslog-ng/requirements.txt (Optional, for monitoring): Install goss and confirm that the version is v0.3.16 or newer. goss installs in /usr/local/bin by default, so ensure that 1) entrypoint.sh is modified to include /usr/local/bin in the full path, or 2) move the goss binary to /bin or /usr/bin . curl - L https : // github . com / aelsabbahy / goss / releases / latest / download / goss - linux - amd64 - o / usr / local / bin / goss chmod + rx / usr / local / bin / goss curl - L https : // github . com / aelsabbahy / goss / releases / latest / download / dgoss - o / usr / local / bin / dgoss # Alternatively, using the latest # curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aelsabbahy/goss/latest/extras/dgoss/dgoss -o /usr/local/bin/dgoss chmod + rx / usr / local / bin / dgoss There are two main options for running SC4S via systemd, the choice of which largely depends on administrator preference and orchestration methodology: 1) the entrypoint.sh script (identical to that used in the container) can be run directly via systemd, or 2) the script can be altered to preconfigure SC4S (after which only the syslog-ng are run via systemd). These are by no means the only ways to run BYOE \u2013 as the name implies, the method you choose will be based on your custom needs. To run the entrypoint.sh script directly in systemd, create the sc4s unit file /lib/systemd/system/sc4s.service and add the following content: [Unit] Description = SC4S Syslog Daemon Documentation = https://splunk-connect-for-syslog.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ Wants = network.target network-online.target After = network.target network-online.target [Service] Type = simple ExecStart = /etc/syslog-ng/entrypoint.sh ExecReload = /bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID EnvironmentFile = /etc/syslog-ng/env_file StandardOutput = journal StandardError = journal Restart = on-abnormal [Install] WantedBy = multi-user.target To run entrypoint.sh as a \u201cpreconfigure\u201d script, modify the script by commenting out or removing the stanzas following the OPTIONAL for BYOE comments in the script.

Now the parsed log should appear in Splunk: As you can see, at this moment, the message is being parsed as a generic *nix:syslog sourcetype. To assign it to the proper index and sourcetype you will need an actual parser. So far we have ensured that the fields in the messages are properly recognized. Create a parser \u00b6 Your parser needs to be declared in package/etc/conf.d/conflib . The naming convention is app-type-vendor_product.conf . If there is a similar parser existing already you can use it as a reference. In the parser, make sure you assign the proper sourcetype, index, vendor, product, and template. The template tells how your message should be parsed before sending it to Splunk. The most basic configuration will only forward raw log with correct metadata. Here is an example: block parser app-syslog-vmware_cb-protect () { channel { rewrite { r_set_splunk_dest_default ( index ( \"epintel\" ) sourcetype ( 'vmware:cb:protect' ) vendor ( \"vmware\" ) product ( \"cb-protect\" ) template ( \"t_msg_only\" ) ) ; } ; } ; } ; application app-syslog-vmware_cb-protect [ sc4s-syslog ] { filter { message ( 'Carbon Black App Control event: ' type ( string ) flags ( prefix )) ; } ; parser { app-syslog-vmware_cb-protect () ; } ; } ; Now all messages that start with the string Carbon Black App Control event: will be routed to the proper index and assigned the given sourcetype: For more info about using message filtering go to sources documentation. If you wish to apply more transformations you will need to add the parser: block parser app-syslog-vmware_cb-protect () { channel { rewrite { r_set_splunk_dest_default ( index ( \"epintel\" ) sourcetype ( 'vmware:cb:protect' ) vendor ( \"vmware\" ) product ( \"cb-protect\" ) template ( \"t_kv_values\" ) ) ; } ; parser { csv-parser ( delimiters ( chars ( '' ) strings ( ': ' )) columns ( 'header' , 'message' ) prefix ( '.tmp.' ) flags ( greedy, drop-invalid )) ; kv-parser ( prefix ( \".values.\" ) pair-separator ( \" \" ) template ( '${.tmp.message}' ) ) ; } ; } ; } ; application app-syslog-vmware_cb-protect [ sc4s-syslog ] { filter { message ( 'Carbon Black App Control event: ' type ( string ) flags ( prefix )) ; } ; parser { app-syslog-vmware_cb-protect () ; } ; } ; In this case, we will extract all fields that are nested in the raw log message first by using csv-parser to split Carbon Black App Control event and the rest of message as a two separate fields named header and message . On top of that, we will use kv-parser to extract all key-value pairs in the message field. The best way to test your parser is to run a previously created test case.

Both options are outlined below. Create a directory on the server for local configurations and disk buffering. This should be available to all administrators, for example: /opt/sc4s/ (Optional for docker-compose ) Create a docker-compose.yml file in the directory created above, based on the template below: IMPORTANT: Always use the latest compose file (below) with the current release. By default, the latest container is automatically downloaded at each restart. Therefore, make it a habit to check back here regularly to be sure any changes that may have been made to the compose template file below (e.g. suggested mount points) are incorporated in production prior to relaunching via compose. version : \"3.7\" services : sc4s : deploy : replicas : 2 restart_policy : condition : on-failure image : ghcr.io/splunk/splunk-connect-for-syslog/container2:2 ports : - target : 514 published : 514 protocol : tcp - target : 514 published : 514 protocol : udp - target : 601 published : 601 protocol : tcp - target : 6514 published : 6514 protocol : tcp env_file : - /opt/sc4s/env_file volumes : - /opt/sc4s/local:/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/local:z - splunk-sc4s-var:/var/lib/syslog-ng # Uncomment the following line if local disk archiving is desired # - /opt/sc4s/archive:/var/lib/syslog-ng/archive:z # Map location of TLS custom TLS # - /opt/sc4s/tls:/etc/syslog-ng/tls:z volumes : splunk-sc4s-var : Set /opt/sc4s folder as shared in Docker (Settings -> Resources -> File Sharing) Execute the following command to create a local volume that will contain the disk buffer files in the event of a communication failure to the upstream destination(s). This will also be used to keep track of the state of syslog-ng between restarts, and in particular the state of the disk buffer. This is a required step. sudo docker volume create splunk - sc4s - var NOTE: Be sure to account for disk space requirements for the docker volume created above. This volume is located in /var/lib/docker/volumes/ and could grow significantly if there is an extended outage to the SC4S destinations (typically HEC endpoints). See the \u201cSC4S Disk Buffer Configuration\u201d section on the Configuration page for more info. IMPORTANT: When creating the directories below, ensure the directories created match the volume mounts specified in the docker-compose.yml file (if used). Failure to do this will cause SC4S to abort at startup. Create subdirectories /opt/sc4s/local /opt/sc4s/archive /opt/sc4s/tls Create a file named /opt/sc4s/env_file and add the following environment variables and values: SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_URL = https : // your . splunk . instance : 8088 SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TOKEN = xxxxxxxx - xxxx - xxxx - xxxx - xxxxxxxxxxxx # Uncomment the following line if using untrusted SSL certificates # SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TLS_VERIFY = no Update SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_URL and SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_DEFAULT_TOKEN to reflect the correct values for your environment. Do not configure HEC Acknowledgement when deploying the HEC token on the Splunk side; the underlying syslog-ng http destination does not support this feature. Moreover, HEC Ack would significantly degrade performance for streaming data such as syslog. The default number of SC4S_DEST_SPLUNK_HEC_WORKERS is 10. Consult the community if you feel the number of workers (threads) should deviate from this. NOTE: Splunk Connect for Syslog defaults to secure configurations. If you are not using trusted SSL certificates, be sure to uncomment the last line in the example above. Dedicated (Unique) Listening Ports \u00b6 NOTE: Container networking differs on MacOS compared to that for linux. On Docker Desktop, there is no \u201chost\u201d networking driver, so NAT networking must be used. For this reason, each listening port on the container must be mapped to a listening port on the host. These port mappings are configured in the docker-compose.yml file or directly as a runtime option when run out of the CLI. Be sure to update the docker-compose.yml file or CLI arguments when adding listening ports for new data sources. Follow these steps to configure unique ports: Modify the /opt/sc4s/env_file file to include the port-specific environment variable(s). Refer to the \u201cSources\u201d documentation to identify the specific environment variables that are mapped to each data source vendor/technology. (Optional for docker-compose ) The docker compose file used to start the SC4S container needs to be modified as well to reflect the additional listening ports configured by the environment variable(s) added above. The docker compose file can be amended with additional target stanzas in the ports section of the file (after the default ports). For example, the following additional target and published lines provide for 21 additional technology-specific UDP and TCP ports: - target: 5000-5020 published: 5000-5020 protocol: tcp - target: 5000-5020 published: 5000-5020 protocol: udp Restart SC4S using the command in the \u201cStart/Restart SC4S\u201d section below.

On Docker Desktop, there is no \u201chost\u201d networking driver, so NAT networking must be used. For this reason, each listening port on the container must be mapped to a listening port on the host. These port mappings are configured in the docker-compose.yml file or directly as a runtime option when run out of the CLI. Be sure to update the docker-compose.yml file or CLI arguments when adding listening ports for new data sources. Follow these steps to configure unique ports: Modify the /opt/sc4s/env_file file to include the port-specific environment variable(s). Refer to the \u201cSources\u201d documentation to identify the specific environment variables that are mapped to each data source vendor/technology.

IPv4 Forwarding \u00b6 In many distributions (e.g. CentOS provisioned in AWS), IPV4 forwarding is not enabled by default. This needs to be enabled for container networking to function properly. The following is an example to check and set this up; as usual this needs to be vetted with your enterprise security policy: To check: sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward To set: sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 To ensure the change survives a reboot: sysctl settings are defined through files in /usr/lib/sysctl.d/ , /run/sysctl.d/ , and /etc/sysctl.d/ . To override only specific settings, you can either add a file with a lexically later name in /etc/sysctl.d/ and put following setting there: net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 or find this specific setting in one of existing configuration files (mentioned above) and set value to 1 . net.ipv4.ip_forward=1 Select a Container Runtime and SC4S Configuration \u00b6 Container Runtime and Orchestration Operating Systems MicroK8s Ubuntu with Microk8s Podman 1.7 & 1.9 + systemd RHEL 8.x or CentOS 8.x (best option), Debian or Ubuntu 18.04LTS Docker CE 19 (and greater) + systemd RHEL or CentOS >7.7 (best option), Debian or Ubuntu 18.04LTS Docker Desktop + Compose MacOS Docker Desktop + Compose RHEL or CentOS 8.1 & 8.2 (best option) Bring your own Environment RHEL or CentOS 8.1 & 8.2 (best option) Offline Container Installation RHEL 8.x or CentOS 8.x (best option), Debian or Ubuntu 18.04LTS Ansible+Docker Swarm RHEL 8.x or CentOS 8.x (best option), Debian or Ubuntu 18.04LTS Ansible+Podman RHEL 7.x/8.x or CentOS 7.x/8.x (best option), Debian or Ubuntu 20.10LTS(and higher) Ansible+Docker RHEL 7.x/8.x or CentOS 7.x/8.x (best option), Debian or Ubuntu 18.04LTS(and higher) Docker and Podman basic configurations \u00b6 To run properly sc4s you need to create directories: /opt/sc4s/local /opt/sc4s/archive /opt/sc4s/tls /opt/sc4s/local will be used as a mount point for local overrides and configurations. The empty local directory created above will populate with defaults and examples at the first invocation of SC4S for local configurations and context overrides. Do not change the directory structure of the files that are laid down; change (or add) only individual files if desired. SC4S depends on the directory layout to read the local configurations properly. See the notes below for which files will be preserved on restarts. In the local/config/ directory there are four subdirectories that allow you to provide support for device types that are not provided out of the box in SC4S. To get you started, there is an example log path template ( lp-example.conf.tmpl ) and a filter ( example.conf ) in the log_paths and filters subdirectories, respectively. These should not be used directly, but copied as templates for your own log path development. They will get overwritten at each SC4S start. In the local/context directory, if you change the \u201cnon-example\u201d version of a file (e.g. splunk_metadata.csv ) the changes will be preserved on a restart. /opt/sc4s/archive will be used as a mount point for local storage of syslog events (if the optional mount is uncommented above). The events will be written in the syslog-ng EWMM format. See the \u201cconfiguration\u201d document for details on the directory structure the archive uses. /opt/sc4s/tls will be used as a mount point for custom TLS certificates (if the optional mount is uncommented above). IMPORTANT: When creating the directories above, ensure the directories created match the volume mounts specified in the sc4s.service unit file . Failure to do this will cause SC4S to abort at startup. Dedicated (Unique) Listening Ports \u00b6 For certain source technologies, categorization by message content is impossible due to the lack of a unique \u201cfingerprint\u201d in the data. In other cases, a unique listening port is required for certain devices due to network requirements in the enterprise. For collection of such sources, we provide a means of dedicating a unique listening port to a specific source. Follow this step to configure unique ports for one or more sources: Modify the /opt/sc4s/env_file file to include the port-specific environment variable(s). Refer to the \u201cSources\u201d documentation to identify the specific environment variables that are mapped to each data source vendor/technology. Modify index destinations for Splunk \u00b6 Log paths are preconfigured to utilize a convention of index destinations that are suitable for most customers. If changes need to be made to index destinations, navigate to the /opt/sc4s/local/context directory to start. Edit splunk_metadata.csv to review or change the index configuration as required for the data sources utilized in your environment. The key (1st column) in this file uses the syntax vendor_product . Simply replace the index value (the 3rd column) in the desired row with the index appropriate for your Splunk installation. The \u201cSources\u201d document details the specific vendor_product keys (rows) in this table that pertain to the individual data source filters that are included with SC4S. Other Splunk metadata (e.g. source and sourcetype) can be overridden via this file as well. This is an advanced topic, and further information is covered in the \u201cLog Path overrides\u201d section of the Configuration document. Configure source filtering by source IP or host name \u00b6 Legacy sources and non-standard-compliant sources require configuration by source IP or hostname as included in the event.

These index-time operations include linebreaking, source/sourcetype setting and timestamping. For this reason, if a data source is exclusively onboarded using SC4S then you will not need to install its corresponding Add-On on the indexers. You must, however, install the Add-on on the search head(s) for the user communities interested in this data source. SC4S is designed to process \u201csyslog\u201d referring to IETF RFC standards 5424, legacy BSD syslog, RFC3164 (Not a standard document), and many \u201calmost\u201d syslog formats. When possible data sources are identified and processed based on characteristics of the event that make them unique as compared to other events for example. Cisco devices using IOS will include \u201d : %\u201d followed by a string. While Arista EOS devices will use a valid RFC3164 header with a value in the \u201cPROGRAM\u201d position with \u201c%\u201d as the first char in the \u201cMESSAGE\u201d portion. This allows two similar event structures to be processed correctly. When identification by message content alone is not possible for example the \u201csshd\u201d program field is commonly used across vendors additional \u201chint\u201d or guidance configuration allows SC4S to better classify events. The hints can be applied by definition of a specific port which will be used as a property of the event or by configuration of a host name/ip pattern. For example \u201cVMWARE VSPHERE\u201d products have a number of \u201cPROGRAM\u201d fields which can be used to identify vmware specific events in the syslog stream and these can be properly sourcetyped automatically however because \u201csshd\u201d is not unique it will be treated as generic \u201cos:nix\u201d events until further configuration is applied. The administrator can take one of two actions to refine the processing for vmware Define a specific port for vmware and reconfigure sources to use the defined port \u201cSC4S_LISTEN_VMWARE_VSPHERE_TCP=9000\u201d. Any events arriving on port 9000 will now have a metadata field attached \u201c.netsource.sc4s_vendor_product=VMWARE_VSPHERE\u201d Define a \u201capp-parser\u201d to apply the metadata field by using a syslog-ng filter to apply the metadata field. Supporting previously unknown sources \u00b6 Many log sources can be supported using one of the flexible options available without specific code known as app-parsers. New supported sources are added regularly. Please submit an issue with a description of the vend/product. Configuration information an a compressed pcap (.zip) from a non-production environment to request support for a new source. Many sources can be self supported. While we encourage sharing new sources via the github project to promote consistency and develop best-practices there is no requirement to engage in the community. Sources that are compliant with RFC 5424,RFC 5425, RFC 5426, or RFC 6587 can be onboarded as simple sources Sources \u201ccompatible\u201d with RFC3164 Note incorrect use of the syslog version, or \u201ccreative\u201d formats in the time stamp or other fields may prevent use as simple sources Common Event Format CEF Also known as ArcSight format Log Extended Format LEEF Almost Syslog \u00b6 Sources sending legacy non conformant 3164 like streams can be assisted by the creation of an \u201cAlmost Syslog\u201d Parser. In an such a parser the goal is to process the syslog header allowing other parsers to correctly parse and handle the event. The following example is take from a currently supported format where the source product used epoch in the time stamp field. #Example event #<134>1 1563249630.774247467 devicename security_event ids_alerted signature=1:28423:1 # In the example note the vendor incorrectly included \"1\" following PRI defined in RFC5424 as indicating a compliant message # The parser must remove the 1 before properly parsing # The epoch time is captured by regex # The epoch time is converted back into an RFC3306 date and provided to the parser block parser syslog_epoch - parser () { channel { filter { message ( ' ^ ( \\ < \\ d + \\ > )( ?: 1 ( ?= )) ? ?

When this happens and only a single source type is desired the \u201csimple\u201d option above is valid but requires managing a port. The following example allows use of a named port OR the vendor product by source configuration. block parser dell_poweredge_cmc - parser () { channel { rewrite { r_set_splunk_dest_default ( index ( ' infraops ' ) sourcetype ( ' dell : poweredge : cmc : syslog ' ) vendor ( ' dell ' ) product ( ' poweredge ' ) class ( ' cmc ' ) ); }; }; }; application dell_poweredge_cmc [ sc4s - network - source ] { filter { ( \"${.netsource.sc4s_vendor_product}\" eq \"dell_poweredge_cmc\" or \"${SOURCE}\" eq \"s_DELL_POWEREDGE_CMC\" ) and \"${fields.sc4s_vendor_product}\" eq \"\" }; parser { dell_poweredge_cmc - parser (); }; }; Filtering events from output \u00b6 In some cases specific events may be considered \u201cnoise\u201d and functionality must be implemented to prevent forwarding of these events to Splunk In version 2.0.0 of SC4S a new feature was implemented to improve the ease of use and efficiency of this progress. The following example will \u201cnull_queue\u201d or drop cisco IOS device events at the debug level. Note Cisco does not use the PRI to indicate DEBUG a message filter is required. block parser cisco_ios_debug - postfilter () { channel { #In this case the outcome is drop the event other logic such as adding indexed fields or editing the message is possible rewrite ( r_set_dest_splunk_null_queue ); }; }; application cisco_ios_debug - postfilter [ sc4s - postfilter ] { filter { \"${fields.sc4s_vendor}\" eq \"cisco\" and \"${fields.sc4s_product}\" eq \"ios\" #Note regex reads as # start from first position # Any atleast 1 char that is not a `-` # constant '-7-' and message ( ' ^% [ ^ \\ - ] + -7 - ' ); }; parser { cisco_ios_debug - postfilter (); }; }; Another example to drop events based on \u201csrc\u201d and \u201caction\u201d values in message \u00b6 #filename: /opt/sc4s/local/app_parsers/rewriters/app-dest-rewrite-checkpoint_drop block parser app - dest - rewrite - checkpoint_drop - d_fmt_hec_default () { channel { rewrite ( r_set_dest_splunk_null_queue ); }; }; application app - dest - rewrite - checkpoint_drop - d_fmt_hec_default [ sc4s - lp - dest - format - d_hec_fmt ] { filter { match ( ' checkpoint ' value ( ' fields . sc4s_vendor ' ) type ( string )) and match ( ' syslog ' value ( ' fields . sc4s_product ' ) type ( string )) and match ( ' Drop ' value ( ' . SDATA . sc4s @ 2620. action ' ) type ( string )) and match ( ' 12. ' value ( ' . SDATA . sc4s @ 2620. src ' ) type ( string ) flags ( prefix ) ); }; parser { app - dest - rewrite - checkpoint_drop - d_fmt_hec_default (); }; }; The SC4S \u201cfallback\u201d sourcetype \u00b6 If SC4S receives an event on port 514 which has no soup filter, that event will be given a \u201cfallback\u201d sourcetype. If you see events in Splunk with the fallback sourcetype, then you should figure out what source the events are from and determine why these events are not being sourcetyped correctly. The most common reason for events categorized as \u201cfallback\u201d is the lack of a SC4S filter for that source, and in some cases a misconfigured relay which alters the integrity of the message format. In most cases this means a new SC4S filter must be developed. In this situation you can either build a filter or file an issue with the community to request help. The \u201cfallback\u201d sourcetype is formatted in JSON to allow the administrator to see the constituent syslog-ng \u201cmacros\u201d (fields) that have been automatically parsed by the syslog-ng server An RFC3164 (legacy BSD syslog) \u201con the wire\u201d raw message is usually (but unfortunately not always) comprised of the following syslog-ng macros, in this order and spacing: <$PRI> $HOST $LEGACY_MSGHDR$MESSAGE These fields can be very useful in building a new filter for that sourcetype. In addition, the indexed field sc4s_syslog_format is helpful in determining if the incoming message is standard RFC3164. A value of anything other than rfc3164 or rfc5424_strict indicates a vendor perturbation of standard syslog, which will warrant more careful examination when building a filter. Splunk Connect for Syslog and Splunk metadata \u00b6 A key aspect of SC4S is to properly set Splunk metadata prior to the data arriving in Splunk (and before any TA processing takes place. The filters will apply the proper index, source, sourcetype, host, and timestamp metadata automatically by individual data source. Proper values for this metadata (including a recommended index) are included with all \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d log paths included with SC4S and are chosen to properly interface with the corresponding TA in Splunk. The administrator will need to ensure all recommended indexes be created to accept this data if the defaults are not changed. It is understood that default values will need to be changed in many installations. Each source documented in this section has a table entitled \u201cSourcetype and Index Configuration\u201d, which highlights the default index and sourcetype for each source. See the section \u201cSC4S metadata configuration\u201d in the \u201cConfiguration\u201d page for more information on how to override the default values in this table. Unique listening ports \u00b6 SC4S supports unique listening ports for each source technology/log path (e.g. Cisco ASA), which is useful when the device is sending data on a port different from the typical default syslog port (UDP port 514). In some cases, when the source device emits data that is not able to be distinguished from other device types, a unique port is sometimes required. The specific environment variables used for setting \u201cunique ports\u201d are outlined in each source document in this section. In most cases only one \u201cunique port\u201d is needed for each source. However, SC4S also supports multiple network listening ports per source, which can be useful for a narrow set of compliance use cases. When configuring a source port variable to enable multiple ports, use a comma-separated list with no spaces (e.g. SC4S_LISTEN_CISCO_ASA_UDP_PORT=5005,6005 ). Filtering by an extra product description \u00b6 Due to the fact that unique listening port feature differentiate vendor and product based on the first two underscore characters (\u2018_\u2019), it is possible to filter events by an extra string added to the product. For example in case of having several devices of the same type sending logs over different ports it is possible to route it to different indexes based only on port value while retaining proper vendor and product fields. In general, it follows convention: SC4S_LISTEN_ { VENDOR } _ { PRODUCT } _ { PROTOCOL } _PORT = { PORT VALUE 1 },{ PORT VALUE 2 }... But for special use cases it can be extended to: SC4S_LISTEN_ { VENDOR } _ { PRODUCT } _ { ADDITIONAL_STRING } _ { PROTOCOL } _PORT = { PORT VALUE },{ PORT VALUE 2 }... This feature removes the need for complex pre/post filters. Example: SC4S_LISTEN_EAMPLEVENDOR_EXAMPLEPRODUCT_GROUP01 - 001 _UDP_PORT = 18514 sets : vendor = < example vendor > product = < example product > tag = . source . s_EAMPLEVENDOR_EXAMPLEPRODUCT_GROUP01 - 001 SC4S_LISTEN_EAMPLEVENDOR_EXAMPLEPRODUCT_GROUP01 - 002 _UDP_PORT = 28514 sets : vendor = < example vendor > product = < example product > tag = . source . s_EAMPLEVENDOR_EXAMPLEPRODUCT_GROUP01 - 002","title":"Read First"},{"location":"sources/#introduction","text":"When using Splunk Connect for Syslog to onboard a data source, the syslog-ng \u201capp-parser\u201d performs the operations that are traditionally performed at index-time by the corresponding Technical Add-on installed there.

The \u201cfallback\u201d sourcetype is formatted in JSON to allow the administrator to see the constituent syslog-ng \u201cmacros\u201d (fields) that have been automatically parsed by the syslog-ng server An RFC3164 (legacy BSD syslog) \u201con the wire\u201d raw message is usually (but unfortunately not always) comprised of the following syslog-ng macros, in this order and spacing: <$PRI> $HOST $LEGACY_MSGHDR$MESSAGE These fields can be very useful in building a new filter for that sourcetype. In addition, the indexed field sc4s_syslog_format is helpful in determining if the incoming message is standard RFC3164. A value of anything other than rfc3164 or rfc5424_strict indicates a vendor perturbation of standard syslog, which will warrant more careful examination when building a filter.","title":"The SC4S \"fallback\" sourcetype"},{"location":"sources/#splunk-connect-for-syslog-and-splunk-metadata","text":"A key aspect of SC4S is to properly set Splunk metadata prior to the data arriving in Splunk (and before any TA processing takes place. The filters will apply the proper index, source, sourcetype, host, and timestamp metadata automatically by individual data source. Proper values for this metadata (including a recommended index) are included with all \u201cout-of-the-box\u201d log paths included with SC4S and are chosen to properly interface with the corresponding TA in Splunk. The administrator will need to ensure all recommended indexes be created to accept this data if the defaults are not changed. It is understood that default values will need to be changed in many installations. Each source documented in this section has a table entitled \u201cSourcetype and Index Configuration\u201d, which highlights the default index and sourcetype for each source.

In some cases, when the source device emits data that is not able to be distinguished from other device types, a unique port is sometimes required. The specific environment variables used for setting \u201cunique ports\u201d are outlined in each source document in this section. In most cases only one \u201cunique port\u201d is needed for each source. However, SC4S also supports multiple network listening ports per source, which can be useful for a narrow set of compliance use cases. When configuring a source port variable to enable multiple ports, use a comma-separated list with no spaces (e.g. SC4S_LISTEN_CISCO_ASA_UDP_PORT=5005,6005 ).","title":"Unique listening ports"},{"location":"sources/#filtering-by-an-extra-product-description","text":"Due to the fact that unique listening port feature differentiate vendor and product based on the first two underscore characters (\u2018_\u2019), it is possible to filter events by an extra string added to the product. For example in case of having several devices of the same type sending logs over different ports it is possible to route it to different indexes based only on port value while retaining proper vendor and product fields. In general, it follows convention: SC4S_LISTEN_ { VENDOR } _ { PRODUCT } _ { PROTOCOL } _PORT = { PORT VALUE 1 },{ PORT VALUE 2 }... But for special use cases it can be extended to: SC4S_LISTEN_ { VENDOR } _ { PRODUCT } _ { ADDITIONAL_STRING } _ { PROTOCOL } _PORT = { PORT VALUE },{ PORT VALUE 2 }...

In general, if you are just starting out with SC4S and wish to simply run with the \u201cstock\u201d configuration, startup out of systemd is recommended. If, on the other hand, you are in the depths of a custom configuration of SC4S with significant modifications (such as multiple unique ports for sources, hostname/CIDR block configuration for sources, new log paths, etc.) then it is best to start SC4S with the container runtime command ( podman or docker ) directly from the command line (below). When you are satisfied with the operation, a transition to systemd can then be made. systemd Errors During SC4S Startup \u00b6 Most issues that occur with startup and operation of sc4s typically involve syntax errors or duplicate listening ports. If you are running out of systemd, you may see this at startup: [ root@sc4s syslog-ng ] # systemctl start sc4s Job for sc4s.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See \"systemctl status sc4s.service\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details. Follow the checks below to resolve the issue: Is the SC4S container running? \u00b6 There may be nothing untoward after starting with systemd, but the container is not running at all after checking with podman logs SC4S or podman ps . A more informative command than journalctl -xe is the following, journalctl -b -u sc4s | tail -100 which will print the last 100 lines of the system journal in far more detail, which should be sufficient to see the specific failure (syntax or runtime) and guide you in troubleshooting why the container exited unexpectedly. Does the SC4S container start (and run) properly outside of the systemd service environment? \u00b6 As an alternative to launching via systemd during the initial installation phase, you may wish to test the container startup outside of the systemd startup environment. This alternative should be considered required when undergoing heavy troubleshooting or log path development (e.g. when SC4S_DEBUG_CONTAINER is set to \u201cyes\u201d). The following command will launch the container directly from the CLI. This command assumes the local mounted directories are set up as shown in the \u201cgetting started\u201d examples; adjust for your local requirements: /usr/bin/podman run \\ -v splunk-sc4s-var:/var/lib/syslog-ng \\ -v /opt/sc4s/local:/etc/syslog-ng/conf.d/local:z \\ -v /opt/sc4s/archive:/var/lib/syslog-ng/archive:z \\ -v /opt/sc4s/tls:/etc/syslog-ng/tls:z \\ --env-file = /opt/sc4s/env_file \\ --network host \\ --name SC4S \\ --rm splunk/scs:latest If you are using docker, substitute \u201cdocker\u201d for \u201cpodman\u201d for the container runtime command above. Is the container still running (when systemd thinks it\u2019s not)? \u00b6 In some instances, (particularly when SC4S_DEBUG_CONTAINER=yes ) an SC4S container might not shut down completely when starting/stopping out of systemd, and systemd will attempt to start a new container when one is already running with the SC4S name. You will see this type of output when viewing the journal after a failed start caused by this condition, or a similar message when the container is run directly from the CLI: Jul 15 18:45:20 sra-sc4s-alln01-02 podman[11187]: Error: error creating container storage: the container name \"SC4S\" is already in use by \"894357502b2a7142d097ea3ca1468d1cb4fbc69959a9817a1bbe145a09d37fb9\". You have to remove that container... Jul 15 18:45:20 sra-sc4s-alln01-02 systemd[1]: sc4s.service: Main process exited, code=exited, status=125/n/a To rectify this, simply execute podman rm -f SC4S SC4S should then start normally. NOTE: This symptom will recur if SC4S_DEBUG_CONTAINER is set to \u201cyes\u201d. Do not attempt to use systemd when this variable is set; use the CLI podman or docker commands directly to start/stop SC4S. HEC/token connection errors (AKA \u201cNo data in Splunk\u201d) \u00b6 SC4S performs basic HEC connectivity and index checks at startup. These indicate general connection issues and indexes that may not be accessible and/or configured on the Splunk side. To check the container logs which contain the results of these tests, run: /usr/bin/<podman | docker> logs SC4S and note the output. You will see entries similar to these: SC4S_ENV_CHECK_HEC : Splunk HEC connection test successful ; checking indexes ... SC4S_ENV_CHECK_INDEX : Checking email { \"text\" : \"Incorrect index\" , \"code\" : 7 , \"invalid-event-number\" : 1 } SC4S_ENV_CHECK_INDEX : Checking epav { \"text\" : \"Incorrect index\" , \"code\" : 7 , \"invalid-event-number\" : 1 } SC4S_ENV_CHECK_INDEX : Checking main { \"text\" : \"Success\" , \"code\" : 0 } Note the specifics of the indexes that are not configured correctly, and rectify in the Splunk configuration. If this is not addressed properly, you may see output similar to the below when data flows into sc4s: Mar 16 19 : 00 : 06 b817af4e89da syslog-ng [ 1 ] : Server returned with a 4XX ( client errors ) status code , which means we are not authorized or the URL is not found .; url = 'https://splunk-instance.com:8088/services/collector/event' , status_code = '400' , driver = 'd_hec#0' , location = '/opt/syslog-ng/etc/conf.d/destinations/splunk_hec.conf:2:5' Mar 16 19 : 00 : 06 b817af4e89da syslog-ng [ 1 ] : Server disconnected while preparing messages for sending , trying again ; driver = 'd_hec#0' , location = '/opt/syslog-ng/etc/conf.d/destinations/splunk_hec.conf:2:5' , worker_index = '4' , time_reopen = '10' , batch_size = '1000' This is an indication that the standard d_hec destination in syslog-ng (which is the route to Splunk) is being rejected by the HEC endpoint. A 400 error (not 404) is normally caused by an index that has not been created on the Splunk side. This can present a serious problem, as just one bad index will \u201ctaint\u201d the entire batch (in this case, 1000 events) and prevent any of them from being sent to Splunk. It is imperative that the container logs be free of these kinds of errors in production. You can use the alternate HEC debug destination (below) to help debug this condition by sending direct \u201ccurl\u201d commands to the HEC endpoint outside of the SC4S setting. SC4S Local Disk Resource Considerations \u00b6 Check the HEC connection to Splunk. If the connection is down for a long period of time, the local disk buffer used for backup will exhaust local disk resources. The size of the local disk buffer is configured in the env_file: Disk buffer configuration Check the env_file to see if SC4S_DEST_GLOBAL_ALTERNATES is set to d_hec_debug , d_archive or other file-based destination; all of these will consume significant local disk space. d_hec_debug and d_archive are organized by sourcetype; the du -sh * command can be used in each subdirectory to find the culprit. Try rebuilding sc4s volume podman volume rm splunk - sc4s - var podman volume create splunk - sc4s - var Try pruning containers podman system prune [--all] SC4S/kernel UDP Input Buffer Settings \u00b6 SC4S has a setting that requests a certain buffer size when configuring the UDP sockets. The kernel must have its parameters set to at least the same size (or greater) than the syslog-ng config is requesting, or the following will occur in the SC4S logs: /usr/bin/<podman | docker> logs SC4S Note the output. The following warning message is not a failure condition unless we are reaching the upper limit of hardware performance. The kernel refused to set the receive buffer (SO_RCVBUF) to the requested size, you probably need to adjust buffer related kernel parameters; so_rcvbuf='1703936', so_rcvbuf_set='425984' Make changes to /etc/sysctl.conf. Changing receive buffer values here to 16 MB: net.core.rmem_default = 17039360 net.core.rmem_max = 17039360 Run following commands for changes to be affected. sysctl -p restart SC4S SC4S TLS Listener Validation \u00b6 To verify the correct configuration of the TLS server use the following command. Replace the IP, FQDN, and port as appropriate: <podman | docker> run -ti drwetter/testssl.sh --severity MEDIUM --ip 127 .0.0.1 selfsigned.example.com:6510 Timezone mismatch in events \u00b6 By default, SC4S resolves the timezone to GMT. If customer have a preference to use local TZ then set the user TZ preference in Splunk during search time rather than at index time. Timezone config documentation Dealing with non RFC-5424 compliant sources \u00b6 If a data source you are trying to ingest claims it is RFC-5424 compliant but you are getting an \u201cError processing log message:\u201d from SC4S, the message violates the standard in some way. Unfortunately multiple vendors claim RFC-5424 compliance without fully testing that they are. In this case, the underlying syslog-ng process will send an error event, with the location of the error in the original event highlighted with >@< to indicate where the error occurred. Here is an example error message: { [ - ] ISODATE : 2020 -05-04 T21 : 21 : 59.001 + 00 : 00 MESSAGE : Error processing log message : < 14 > 1 2020 -05-04 T21 : 21 : 58.117351 + 00 : 00 arcata - pks - cluster -1 pod . log / cf - workloads / logspinner - testing -6446 b8ef - - [ kubernetes @47450 cloudfoundry . org / process_type = \"web\" cloudfoundry . org / rootfs - version = \"v75.0.0\" cloudfoundry . org / version = \"eae53cc3-148d-4395-985c-8fef0606b9e3\" controller - revision - hash = \"logspinner-testing-6446b8ef05-7db777754c\" cloudfoundry . org / app_guid = \"f71634fe-34a4-4f89-adac-3e523f61a401\" cloudfoundry . org / source_type = \"APP\" security . istio . io / tlsMode = \"istio\" statefulset . kubernetes . io / pod - n > @ < ame = \"logspinner-testing-6446b8ef05-0\" cloudfoundry . org / guid = \"f71634fe-34a4-4f89-adac-3e523f61a401\" namespace_name = \"cf-workloads\" object_name = \"logspinner-testing-6446b8ef05-0\" container_name = \"opi\" vm_id = \"vm-e34452a3-771e-4994-666e-bfbc7eb77489\" ] Duration 10.00299412 s TotalSent 10 Rate 0.999701 PID : 33 PRI : < 43 > PROGRAM : syslog - ng } In this example the error can be seen in the snippet statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-n>@<ame . Looking at the spec for RFC5424, it states that the \u201cSD-NAME\u201d (the left-hand side of the name=value pairs) cannot be longer than 32 printable ASCII characters. In this message, the indicated name exceeds that. Unfortunately, this is a spec violation on the part of the vendor. Ideally the vendor would address this violation so their logs would be RFC-5424 compliant. Alternatively, an exception could be added to the SC4S filter log path (or an alternative (workaround) log path created) for the data source if the vendor can\u2019t/won\u2019t fix the defect. In this example, the reason RAWMSG is not shown in the fields above is because this error message is coming from syslog-ng itself \u2013 not the filter/log path. In messages of the type Error processing log message: where the PROGRAM is shown as syslog-ng , that is the clue your incoming message is not RFC-5424 compliant (though it\u2019s often close, as is the case here).","title":"SC4S Startup and Validation"},{"location":"troubleshooting/troubleshoot_SC4S_server/#sc4s-server-startup-and-operational-validation","text":"The following sections will guide the administrator to the most commons solutions to startup and operational issues with SC4S.

Here is an example error message: { [ - ] ISODATE : 2020 -05-04 T21 : 21 : 59.001 + 00 : 00 MESSAGE : Error processing log message : < 14 > 1 2020 -05-04 T21 : 21 : 58.117351 + 00 : 00 arcata - pks - cluster -1 pod . log / cf - workloads / logspinner - testing -6446 b8ef - - [ kubernetes @47450 cloudfoundry . org / process_type = \"web\" cloudfoundry . org / rootfs - version = \"v75.0.0\" cloudfoundry . org / version = \"eae53cc3-148d-4395-985c-8fef0606b9e3\" controller - revision - hash = \"logspinner-testing-6446b8ef05-7db777754c\" cloudfoundry . org / app_guid = \"f71634fe-34a4-4f89-adac-3e523f61a401\" cloudfoundry . org / source_type = \"APP\" security . istio . io / tlsMode = \"istio\" statefulset . kubernetes . io / pod - n > @ < ame = \"logspinner-testing-6446b8ef05-0\" cloudfoundry . org / guid = \"f71634fe-34a4-4f89-adac-3e523f61a401\" namespace_name = \"cf-workloads\" object_name = \"logspinner-testing-6446b8ef05-0\" container_name = \"opi\" vm_id = \"vm-e34452a3-771e-4994-666e-bfbc7eb77489\" ] Duration 10.00299412 s TotalSent 10 Rate 0.999701 PID : 33 PRI : < 43 > PROGRAM : syslog - ng } In this example the error can be seen in the snippet statefulset.kubernetes.io/pod-n>@<ame . Looking at the spec for RFC5424, it states that the \u201cSD-NAME\u201d (the left-hand side of the name=value pairs) cannot be longer than 32 printable ASCII characters. In this message, the indicated name exceeds that. Unfortunately, this is a spec violation on the part of the vendor. Ideally the vendor would address this violation so their logs would be RFC-5424 compliant. Alternatively, an exception could be added to the SC4S filter log path (or an alternative (workaround) log path created) for the data source if the vendor can\u2019t/won\u2019t fix the defect. In this example, the reason RAWMSG is not shown in the fields above is because this error message is coming from syslog-ng itself \u2013 not the filter/log path. In messages of the type Error processing log message: where the PROGRAM is shown as syslog-ng , that is the clue your incoming message is not RFC-5424 compliant (though it\u2019s often close, as is the case here).","title":"Dealing with non RFC-5424 compliant sources"},{"location":"troubleshooting/troubleshoot_resources/","text":"SC4S Logging and Troubleshooting Resources \u00b6 Helpful Linux and Container Commands \u00b6 Linux service (systemd) commands \u00b6 Check service status systemctl status sc4s Start service systemctl start service Stop service systemctl stop service Restart service systemctl restart service Enabling service at boot systemctl enable sc4s Query the system journal journalctl -b -u sc4s Container Commands \u00b6 NOTE: All container commands below can be run with either runtime ( podman or docker ).

This is the only way to determine if SC4S parsers and filters are operating correctly, as raw messages are needed for \u201cplayback\u201d when testing. In addition, the community supporting SC4S will always first ask for raw samples (kind of like the way Splunk support always asks for \u201cdiags\u201d) before any development or troubleshooting exercise. Here are some options for obtaining raw logs for one or more sourcetypes: Run tcpdump on the collection interface and display the results in ASCII. You will see events of the form < 165 > 1 2007 -02 -15 T09 : 17 : 15.719 Z router1 mgd 3046 UI_DBASE_LOGOUT_EVENT [ junos @2636.1.1.1.2.18 username = \"user\" ] User ' user ' exiting configuration mode buried in the packet contents. Set the variable SC4S_SOURCE_STORE_RAWMSG=yes in env_file and restart sc4s. This will store the raw message in a syslog-ng macro called RAWMSG and will be displayed in Splunk for all fallback messages. For most other sourcetypes, the RAWMSG is not displayed, but can be surfaced by changing the output template to one of the JSON variants (t_JSON_3164 or t_JSON_5424 depending on RFC message type). See SC4S metadata configuration for more details. ** IMPORTANT! Be sure to turn off the RAWMSG variable when you are finished, as it doubles the memory and disk requirements of sc4s. Do not use RAWMSG in production! Lastly, you can enable the alternate destination d_rawmsg for one or more sourcetypes. This destination will write the raw messages to the container directory /var/syslog-ng/archive/rawmsg/<sourcetype> (which is typically mapped locally to /opt/sc4s/archive ). Within this directory, the logs are organized by host and time. This method can be useful when raw samples are needed for events that partially parse (or parse into the wrong sourcetype) and the output template is not JSON (see above). \u201cexec\u201d into the container (advanced) \u00b6 You can confirm how the templating process created the actual syslog-ng config files that are in use by \u201cexec\u2019ing in\u201d to the container and navigating the syslog-ng config filesystem directly. To do this, run /usr/bin/podman exec -it SC4S /bin/bash and navigate to /opt/syslog-ng/etc/ to see the actual config files in use. If you are adept with container operations and syslog-ng itself, you can modify files directly and reload syslog-ng with the command kill -1 1 in the container. You can also run the /entrypoint.sh script by hand (or a subset of it, such as everything but syslog-ng) and have complete control over the templating and underlying syslog-ng process. This is an advanced topic and further help can be obtained via the github issue tracker and Slack channels. Keeping a failed container running (even more advanced) \u00b6 When debugging a configuration syntax issue at startup, it is often helpful to keep the container running after a syslog-ng startup failure. In order to facilitate troubleshooting and make \u201con the fly\u201d syslog-ng configuration changes from within a running container, the container can be forced to remain running when syslog-ng fails to start (which normally terminates the container). This can be enabled by adding SC4S_DEBUG_CONTAINER=yes to the env_file . Use this capability in conjunction with \u201cexec-ing\u201d into the container described above. NOTE: Do not attempt to enable the debug container mode while running out of systemd. Run the container manually from the CLI, as podman or docker commands will be required to start, stop, and optionally clean up cruft left behind by the debug process. Only when SC4S_DEBUG_CONTAINER is set to \u201cno\u201d (or completely unset) should systemd startup processing resume. Fix timezone \u00b6 Mismatch in TZ can occur if SC4S and logHost are not in same TZ. This is commonly occurring problem. To fix it one must create a filter using sc4s-lp-dest-format-d_hec_fmt . Example: #filename: /opt/sc4s/local/app_parsers/rewriters/app-dest-rewrite-fix_tz_something.conf block parser app - dest - rewrite - checkpoint_drop - d_fmt_hec_default () { channel { rewrite { fix - time - zone ( \"EST5EDT\" ); }; }; }; application app - dest - rewrite - fix_tz_something - d_fmt_hec_default [ sc4s - lp - dest - format - d_hec_fmt ] { filter { match ( ' checkpoint ' value ( ' fields . sc4s_vendor ' ) type ( string )) <- this has to be customized and match ( ' syslog ' value ( ' fields . sc4s_product ' ) type ( string )) <- this has to be customized and match ( ' Drop ' value ( ' .

SDATA . sc4s @2620. src ' ) type ( string ) flags ( prefix ) ); <- this has to be customized }; parser { app - dest - rewrite - fix_tz_something - d_fmt_hec_default (); }; }; Or create a post-filter if destport, container, proto are not available in indexed fields: ``` filename: /opt/sc4s/local/config/app_parsers/rewriters/app-dest-rewrite-fix_tz_something.conf \u00b6 block parser app-dest-rewrite-fortinet_fortios-d_fmt_hec_default() { channel { rewrite { fix-time-zone(\u201cEST5EDT\u201d); }; }; }; application app-dest-rewrite-device-d_fmt_hec_default[sc4s-postfilter] { filter { match(\u201cxxxx\u201d, value(\u201cfields.sc4s_destport\u201d) type(glob)); <- this has to be customized }; parser { app-dest-rewrite-fortinet_fortios-d_fmt_hec_default(); }; }; ``` Note that filter match statement should be aligned to your data!
